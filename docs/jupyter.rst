Jupyter tutorial
===============

Installation
==============

Install

    $ virtualenv jupyter
    $ source ./jupyter/bin/activate
    $ pip install jupyter

Start your notebook saying::

    $ jupyter notebook

This will start a local notebook server. In my case, this was in url http://localhost:8888/?token=f1639d6df03110fdbbfb07bf7c29a9336156864ceb756862
You can then start creating a notebook interactively clicking on the ``New`` button on the top right.
